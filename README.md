## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2018 to better understand:

1. What differs in being a Developer at 40's?
2. What can a developer at 40's do to improve Job Satisfaction and/or Salary?
3. What are the key factors that can predict salary in this age group?

Please send other suggestions for questions to: aagissp@gmail.com


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook that provides visualizations and code to answer these questions.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@aagiss/developers-at-35-45yo-5-suggestions-to-improve-job-satisfaction-and-salary-2e3e1055b12f).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information (https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
